Setup has been completed already for this lab.

Access the lab in Canvas and write the code for the exercises within the app.js file.

Check each exercise by running the code using one of the two methods:

- Open the index.html file in your browser and access the console output in your browserâ€™s dev tools.
- Use node to execute the app.js file directly in terminal with `node app.js` (make sure that you are in the lab's folder)

Upon completion please commit your work:

1. git add -A
2. git commit -m "add your message inside quotes"
3. git push

Then submit the URL link to the specific repository end point into Canvas. There should be an input field at the bottom of the assignment requesting the URL. Click "submit" and you should be all set!
