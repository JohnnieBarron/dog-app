Setup has been completed already for this lab.

The markup in index.html and the CSS in style.css is complete. Code the JavaScript logic within the app.js file.

Check your work as you code by opening the index.html file in your browser and accessing the console output in your browserâ€™s dev tools as you interact with the calculator.

Upon completion please commit your work:

1. git add -A
2. git commit -m "add your message inside quotes"
3. git push

Then submit the URL link to the specific repository end point into in Canvas. There should be a text field at the bottom of the assignment requesting the URL. Click "submit" and you should be all set!
